<p>My name is Joseph but I mostly go by Joe or Murche</p> 
<p>OSU email: murchej@oregonstate.edu</p> 


<p>I am a Computer Science/Cyber Security major, in my 4th year at OSU but only my 2nd year in the Computer Science program.</p>


<p>The most complex work with web development that I have done was creating my own website my sophomore year of highschool when I was 15. I built a Portland Trail Blazer
    fanpage using HTML and CSS.</p>


<p>In this class, I hope to gain the tools I need to build a website and app for my girlfriends personal training business.</p>


<p>Yes, I have signed up for CampusWire.</p>


<p>A unique experience that I have had is attending the 2021 United States Grand Prix for Formula 1 racing. There were about 400,000 people in attendance, and my girlfriend and
    I had a great time. The rivalry between drivers Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton created a very exciting race, and the battles between Ferrari and McLaren added to the fun.
